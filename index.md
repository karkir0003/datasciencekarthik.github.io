## Welcome!

I'm a second year undergraduate Computer Science student at Georgia Institute of Technology with focus on Artificial Intelligence and Modeling/Simulation. I'm from Belle Mead, NJ. 

As the amount of data being produced is increasing rapidly, it's interesting to be able to derive meaning from data in order to make informed decisions. As a result, I became interested in using data science to help solve challenging problems. 

### What have I been up to?

I've been involved with a student organization called Data Science Club at Georgia Tech (DSGT). The main mission of this club is to make data science accessible for those who are new to the field and DSGT provides a virtual bootcamp curriculum, project opportunities, Hacklytics, and more to drive this mission forward. I'm currently part of the Content Team and my main responsibilities include developing interactive Python notebooks to illuminate the fundamentals of data science and presenting content to audience of 50+ students. Check out our [website](https://datasciencegt.org/) to learn more about the organization!

Occassionally, I'm actively exploring new areas of Computer Science through side projects with friends and through hackathons.


### Past Projects
1. **Stock Analysis Project**
- Project for Hacklytics 2020 (data science oriented hackathon) done in a team of 3 people
- The algorithm scrapes Reddit data on a given company to predict the next day's stock price
- AlphaVantage API was used to get the stock price data while the Pushshift API was used to get the relevant Reddit posts
- SpaCy toolkit was used for processing the Reddit data and Random Forest Regressor was used as the model on a dataset of 30000+
- Acheived accuracy of 85-95% with mean absolute error of $33.70 on a dataset with standard deviation $69
- [Repository Link](https://github.com/dakshthemaker/Stonks)
- [Devpost Submission](https://devpost.com/software/stonks-i431j0)
2. **Farm Simulation Application**
•	Leveraged Agile Design Principles to develop an interactive Java FX farm simulation application in a team of 5 over the course of the Fall 2020 semester
•	Implemented OOP principles to develop framework, extensively tested codebase using Junit framework

### What do I do outside of work?

When I'm not busy, I like to play card games with my friends. I'm willing to pick up any new card games, so feel free to message me about your favorite card games! I also like to watch intriguing TED-talks. I'm also a fan of logic puzzles (I'm currently reading a book called "Alice in Puzzleland" by Raymond Smullyan and so far enjoy his style of writing). Currently, I'm learning to cook and so far enjoy the process.
