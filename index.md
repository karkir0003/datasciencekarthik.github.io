## Welcome!

I'm a second year undergraduate Computer Science student at Georgia Institute of Technology with focus on Artificial Intelligence and Modeling/Simulation. I'm from Belle Mead, NJ. 

As the amount of data being produced is increasing rapidly, it's interesting to be able to derive meaning from data in order to make informed decisions. As a result, I became interested in using data science to help solve challenging problems.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/karkir0003/karkir0003.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
